Léo loved exploring the world around him and had a wild imagination that took him on incredible journeys. One sunny afternoon, Léo stumbled upon a peculiar door hidden deep within his grandmother's attic. It was covered in dust and cobwebs, which made it seem as if no one had opened it in years. Curiosity filled Léo's heart as he wondered what lay behind the door. With a deep breath, he slowly turned the rusty doorknob and pushed the door open.\n",
